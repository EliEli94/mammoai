# MammoAI

MammoAI is a web application built with Django, designed to assist radiologists in predicting and assessing breast cancer from mammogram images. It utilizes advanced machine learning models to determine whether an image is benign or malignant, and generates a heatmap to highlight the affected areas. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive risk assessment to aid in clinical decision-making.
